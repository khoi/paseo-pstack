# Build the change and clean the diff

The build playbooks share one discipline. Say what you observed, let the playbook demand the evidence. This page shows what to put in the prompt for each common build task, then the cleanup habit that keeps diffs reviewable.

## Prompt each build playbook with what you know

A bug prompt states the symptom and asks for a reproduction first:

```text
/poteto-mode this command emits two records after a retry. repro first, then fix and verify.
```

A feature prompt states the behavior and what must not change:

```text
/poteto-mode add a --json flag. text output stays byte-identical. verify both forms.
```

A refactoring prompt pins behavior before structure moves:

```text
/poteto-mode move parsing into one module, zero behavior change. record the current output first and prove it's unchanged after.
```

These prompts route to [Bug fix](../../skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/bug-fix.md), [Feature](../../skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/feature.md), or [Refactoring](../../skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/refactoring.md). Each playbook supplies its own implementation and verification steps.

## Write the failing test first with `/tdd`

When a bug has a cheap local test path, the whole prompt can be two words:

```text
/tdd implement
```

In context, that's enough. [`/tdd`](../../skills/tdd/SKILL.md) writes the smallest test that fails for the intended reason, then the fix, then reruns the test. If a test would need broad harness setup or brittle mocks, the skill says so and uses the closest executable check instead. Don't force a test where a real command is stronger evidence.

## Clean before you commit

The [Opening a PR playbook](../../skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/opening-a-pr.md) runs `/deslop` on the diff before each commit and applies [`/unslop`](../../skills/unslop/SKILL.md) to the PR description and commit bodies. `/deslop` is a separate skill, not in pstack. If you don't have it, ask for the same outcome in plain words: remove narrating comments, unsupported guards, dead compatibility paths, and unrelated edits.

For prose, `/unslop` takes a target and any extra rules you have:

```text
/unslop the readme changes, no emdashes
```

You'll develop your own shorthand. The skill reads intent fine from terse prompts like `unslop that, tighten it`.

**Pitfall:** cleanup is not optional polish. A diff with narrating comments and defensive dead weight reads as unfinished to reviewers, and the extra code is where the next bug hides. If the diff feels padded, say `deslop it` before you commit, not after review calls it out.

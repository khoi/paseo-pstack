# Make it yours

poteto-mode is one person's style. The machinery underneath, playbooks, routing, model roles, works just as well wearing yours. This page covers generating a personal mode, generating a project verification skill, and writing technical docs.

## Generate your own mode with `/automate-me`

```text
/automate-me
```

You don't describe your style, because [`/automate-me`](../../skills/automate-me/SKILL.md) reads it out of your history. It mines your recent transcripts in the active workspace for repeated preferences, in how you like replies, delegation, verification, code, prose, and process, then asks you which patterns are really you. It drafts `.agents/skills/<your-name>-mode/SKILL.md` through the `create-skill` skill if installed, runs the draft through [`/unslop`](../../skills/unslop/SKILL.md), and opens a PR from a worktree so you review it like any other change.

Run it again whenever your habits drift:

```text
/automate-me update my mode skill with everything since its last edit
```

Update mode mines only the history since the skill last changed. It keeps rules you haven't contradicted, revises the ones with new evidence, and adds sections only for genuinely new patterns.

## Generate a verification skill

Use [`/create-verification-skill`](../../skills/create-verification-skill/SKILL.md) to generate and prove an app verification harness, then [`/maintain-verification-skill`](../../skills/maintain-verification-skill/SKILL.md) to keep it current. [Verify and open a PR](./06-verify-and-ship.md#create-a-project-verification-skill) covers both.

## Write docs to a standard with `/technical-writing`

Skills aren't the only prose you ship. For docs, RFCs, readmes, PR descriptions, and commit messages:

```text
/technical-writing review the readme changes
```

[`/technical-writing`](../../skills/technical-writing/SKILL.md) applies a layered standard with one goal, prose a tired engineer understands on the first read. It picks the document's mode first (tutorial, how-to, reference, or explanation), then works sentence by sentence: who does what, one thought per sentence, nothing readable two ways. Use it to review what you or an agent just wrote, or name it up front when you ask for a doc.

**Pitfall:** don't edit a skill mid-task because it's misbehaving. Fix it in its own PR and keep the task moving. A skill edit that ships tangled into feature work is invisible to review and impossible to evaluate.
